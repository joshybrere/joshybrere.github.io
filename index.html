        <p id="opportunity">I have learned so much about HTML in the first four weeks of my Web Development class.  Let's take a look at some of the HTML Properties I have learned.</p>
        <section id="class">
            <ul>
                <li>Paragraphs start and end with the p tag</li>
                <li>Headers have h tags that are numbered from 1-6 with 1 being the highest and 6 the lowest. Ex: h1 tag is bigger than an h3 tag.
                <li>An em tag can make an emphasis on word as shown below:</li><em>Josh</em>
                <li>A strong tag can bold a phrase as seen below</li><strong>HTML is awesome</strong>
                <li>You can share a picture through HTML.<img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/cute/CharacterCatGirl.png" alt="cute character"></li>
                 </ul>
                 </section>

        <h6 id="date">October 9th, 2020</h6>
        <p id="learn">Look at all of the wonderful things that I have learned about CSS!  I will be using some of these styles to change font size, change colors in Paragraphs, Headers, and will align text to center on my paragraphs!  I will also be making all of this HTML into a fantasy font style and will make the October 5th, 2020 entry italicized!
